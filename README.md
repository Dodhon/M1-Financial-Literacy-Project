# M1-Financial-Literacy-Project
  Many young people are not informed about the proper usage of a credit card. Frequent usage can lead to spiraling debt, yet avoidance will lead to the inability to take out car or home loans at a feasible rate. Buying a house and a car are both enormous milestones, both financially and in life, yet many bright young people are limited in their ability to do so due to their credit scores. College-aged American citizens have more than sixteen thousand dollars in debt on average with interest rates as high as 25%.
