# M1-Financial-Literacy-Project
  Many young people are not informed about the proper usage of a credit card. Frequent usage can lead to spiraling debt, yet avoidance will lead to the inability to take out car or home loans at a feasible rate. Buying a house and a car are both enormous milestones, both financially and in life, yet many bright young people are limited in their ability to do so due to their credit scores. College-aged American citizens have more than sixteen thousand dollars in debt on average with interest rates as high as 25%. 
  
  
  
  
  
   Our goal is to address this problem by creating a Choose-Your-Own-Adventure style java program. This entails a series of prompts that the user can follow in order to find information that is most suitable for their individual situation. All information presented in this project are sourced from reputable sources.
